    Olle means 'a narrow walkway from the gate of the house to the main road' in Jeju dialect. In 2007, the first route was opened, 
    and a total of 26 routes covering 425 km have been developed, with more being added quite regularly.</p>

    <p>Each route is around 15km or less, with an average travel time of 5 to 6 hours, with spur routes available on nearby islands.
